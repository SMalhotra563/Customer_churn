# Customer_churn

This Telco Customer Churn project explores customer demographics, services and features, 
as well as personal details to gain insights into churn behavior. 
It delves into gender distribution, senior citizens, dependents, and partners in both the overall customer base and among churned customers. 
Additionally, it investigates the influence of various services, such as phone, online security, internet, tech services, online backup, device protection, contract types, tenure, 
and payment methods on customer churn. By scrutinizing personal details and overall churn rates, 
this analysis aims to uncover factors and patterns associated with customer attrition in the telco industry.
